## Features

- **Products and delivery** — automatic card-key delivery, manual delivery (optionally delivered the moment payment arrives), card-key pre-selection (buyers pick a specific key, with an optional surcharge), categories and SKU options, wholesale pricing, flash sales, coupons, purchase limits, login-only products, custom order fields and email notifications.
- **Pricing and members** — separate guest and member prices, fully custom member and merchant levels, and per-level pricing for every product.
- **Payments** — every payment gateway is a plugin, so almost any channel can be connected; account balance and online top-ups are built in.
- **Sub-stores** — members can open their own sub-store on its own domain, list their own products, or resell the main store's.
- **Referral earnings** — member levels double as agent levels: a referrer earns the difference between what the buyer paid and the price at the referrer's own level.
- **Store-to-store supply** — connect another store's products from the admin panel and restock and deliver them automatically from your balance.
- **App store** — install plugins and themes from the admin panel; the core upgrades online with one click.
- **Languages and currencies** — Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English and Japanese built in, with your own site currency and exchange rate.
- **Security** — two-factor authentication and passkey sign-in, a hidden admin entrance, a Content Security Policy and other layers of protection.
- **Look and feel** — full desktop and mobile support, with many themes in different styles available in the app store.
- **Extensible** — more than 80 hook points let plugins take over ordering, delivery, payment and more. For example: game items sent straight to the player's inventory, software licences issued and balances topped up automatically, or forum and community VIP status granted on purchase.

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d --name faka -p 80:80 -v acg_data:/data --restart unless-stopped ghcr.io/lizhipay/acg-faka:latest
```

The image bundles MariaDB and Redis. Once it starts, open `http://your-server-ip` and the installer comes up with the database details already filled in. Everything the site stores lives in the `/data` volume, so always mount it. To use a separate MySQL server, see the [Docker guide](https://faka.wiki/en/install/docker).

### Option 2: aaPanel or manual install

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| PHP | 8.0 or newer (8.2 recommended) |
| MySQL | 5.7 or newer (MariaDB 10.3+ also works) |
| PHP extensions | `gd`, `curl`, `pdo`, `pdo_mysql`, `date`, `json`, `session`, `zip`, `bcmath` |
| URL rewriting | Required, see below |

1. Get the source: `composer create-project lizhipay/acg-faka`, or download a zip from [GitHub](https://github.com/lizhipay/acg-faka) or [faka.wiki/download.php](https://faka.wiki/download.php).
2. Set up URL rewriting. Apache needs nothing, because the root directory already ships a `.htaccess`. On Nginx, paste the whole block below into the site configuration (aaPanel: Website → URL rewrite).

   ```nginx
   if ($uri ~* "^/(?!(?-i:index\.php)(/|$)).*\.php(/|$)")             { return 404; }

   location ~* ^/(runtime|kernel|config|vendor)/                { return 404; }
   location ~  (^|/)(runtime|\.acgcache)(/|$)                   { return 404; }
   location ~  /\.(?!well-known)                                { return 404; }
   location ~* \.(log|sql|sqlite|db|db-wal|db-shm|bak|old|save|orig|swp|swo|tmp|ini|lock|key|pem|crt|cer|der|p12|pfx|p8|keystore|jks|asc|gpg|ppk|env|secret)$  { return 404; }
   location ~* (~|composer\.(json|lock)|package(-lock)?\.json)$ { return 404; }
   location / {
       try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?s=$uri&$args;
   }
   ```

   Copy the whole block, not just the final `location /`: the rules above it keep logs, configuration files, keys and similar files from being served. IIS rules are in the [rewrite guide](https://faka.wiki/en/install/rewrite).
3. Make sure `config`, `runtime`, `kernel/Install` and `assets/cache` are writable, then open the home page and follow the installer.
4. The admin panel is at `https://your-domain/admin`.

Step-by-step guides, including Windows, are in the [installation docs](https://faka.wiki/en/install/).

## Upgrading

The current version number sits in the bottom-left corner of the admin panel. Click it to check for a new version and upgrade online in one click; this works for Docker installs too. Back up your database first. For manual upgrades, see the [upgrade guide](https://faka.wiki/en/install/upgrade).

## Development

Plugins, payment plugins, hooks and the API are covered in the [developer docs](https://faka.wiki/en/dev/).
